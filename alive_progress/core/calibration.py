def calibrated_fps(calibrate):
    """Calibration of the dynamic frames per second engine.

    I've started with the equation y = log10(x + m) * k + n, where:
      y is the desired fps, m and n are horizontal and vertical translation,
      k is a calibration factor, computed from some user input c (see readme for details).

    Considering minfps and maxfps as given constants, I came to:
      fps = log10(x + 1) * k + minfps, which must be equal to maxfps for x = c,
    so the factor k = (maxfps - minfps) / log10(c + 1), and
      fps = log10(x + 1) * (maxfps - minfps) / log10(c + 1) + minfps

    Neat! ;)
