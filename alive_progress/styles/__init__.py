# I want to create some kind of extension point here. Then users would be able to create
# and share their custom styles with the community! Ideally it should be simple to distribute
# them, don't know for sure how. As a last resort, I could include them all here in this package,
# via the usual fork / pull request contribution, and I'll dynamically find and make them usable.
